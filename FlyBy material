Extension UI pages, such as a popup, can contain ordinary HTML pages with JavaScript logic. Extensions can also call tabs.create or window.open() to display additional HTML files present in the extension.  
--> interacting with the browser itself


https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/overview --> schemes for background, popup, content

 //THIS CODE WORKS
  chrome.tabs.query({'active': true}, function(tabs) {
    chrome.tabs.update(tabs[0].id, {url: newUrl});
  });
  someOtherFunction();

"At a very basic level, a Chrome extension is just some HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows you to add some functionality to Chrome through some of the JavaScript APIs Chrome exposes. An extension is basically just a web page that is hosted within Chrome and can access some additional APIs."
